# Information-Theoretic Approach to Optimal Experimental Design of Current Profiles for Accurate Battery Parameter Estimation

## 1. Main Idea

### Background
- Increasing adoption of physics-based electrochemical models requires accurate parameter estimation.  
- Previous studies mainly focused on improving parameter estimator algorithms.  
- However, the impact of **current profile design** on estimation performance has been largely overlooked.  
- Model parameter identifiability is governed by the applied current profile.
